## 📌 About the Project
This repository contains the complete source code for the **Landing Page** I developed during my internship at **Sunil Bhor & Associates, Nashik**. The landing page is built with modern web technologies to ensure a seamless and responsive experience.

Additionally, I implemented an **Appointment System** to facilitate seamless scheduling and management of appointments.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Next.js 15** - React framework for production-ready applications.
- **React 19** - Latest React version for component-based UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
- **Appwrite** - Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for authentication and database management.
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management solution.
